# cros_camera_service provides camera service to both Chrome and ARC++:
# Chrome hosts the CameraHalDispatcher Mojo proxy; cros_camera_service forks a
# child process to host the camera HAL adapter and registers to
# CameraHalDispatcher Mojo proxy.  Camera clients can then ask
# CameraHalDispatcher Mojo proxy to get the handle to connect to the camera HAL
# adapter.
