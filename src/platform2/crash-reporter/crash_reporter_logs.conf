#
# This file is parsed by chromeos::KeyValueStore. It has the format:
#
# <exec_name>=<shell command>\n
#
# When a collector processes a crash, the corresponding command is executed and
# its standard output and standard error are attached to the crash report.
#
# The <exec_name> corresponds to exec_name used in the various collectors.
# For OS programs that crash (e.g. coredump), this will be the program's
# basename.  For example, if /usr/bin/powerd crashes, it will be "powerd".
# For other collectors, the exec_name might have other values, so you'll have
# to consult the collector itself.  For example, kernel warnings might be one
# of "kernel-warning", or "kernel-wifi-warning", or "kernel-suspend-warning".
#
# Shell commands may be split across multiple lines using trailing backslashes.
#
# The contents of the log will be stripped for some potentially sensitive info
# (see CrashCollector::StripSensitiveData for a description of what gets
# stripped), but try to avoid collection of potential PII at all times.
#
# Use caution in modifying this file. Only run common Unix commands here, as
# these commands will be run when a crash has recently occurred and we should
# avoid running anything that might cause another crash. Similarly, these
# commands block notification of the crash to parent processes, so commands
# should execute quickly.

# Fingerprint system daemon.
# Unfortunately, the fingerprint services are somewhat coupled together through
# communication with the FPMCU. So, errors that could occur in bio_crypto_init
# and bio_fw_updater can cause bad behavior in biod. For this reason, we must
# collect logs from the previous tasks to understand a biod failure.
# Keep in mind that the minidump itself could be about 50KB, the process_tree
# log could be about 2KB, and each additional biod related log could be nearly
# 10KB. The max combined upload size must be less than 1MB, or the additional
# logs will be omitted.
