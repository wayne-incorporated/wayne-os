# Study parameters for FPC1025.
# Expect between 60 to 72 participants using Participant Groups - Option 3.
#
# During a normal enrollment with no faults (like low coverage) only 5
# samples are needed. We collect 10 enrollment captures to account for
# potentialy faulty enrollment captures. The biometric evaluation tool
# will only use as many captures as it needs to get coverage, which
# should be 5 normally. This attempts to simulate the normal enrollment
# flow, where a capture would be rejected if it contributed too little
# coverage.
#
# Fingers:         6
# Enrollment:      10
# Template Update: 20
# Verification:    60
#
# Capture 6 different fingers per participant.
env FINGER_COUNT=6
# Capture 10 enrollment samples per finger.
env ENROLLMENT_COUNT=10
# Capture 20 template update samples + the 60 verification samples per finger.
