# We use this file to override the device renaming that would be done by the

#
# The problem with the rules provided by the bsp is that they confuse
# the CrOS WiFi test framework. In particular, the CrOS WiFi test
# framework creates and names WiFi devices in the course of normal
# operation. Having UDEV rename those device confuses the test
# framework.
