# NOTE: this job is not automatically started on boot-up as it is
#       expected to be started manually (e.g. "initctl start p2p" or
#       similar) by software (such as the auto-update system) that
#       wants to advertise or find content.

# Let p2p service be killable as it can restore itself when it's
# consuming too much memory.
