        @policy_blob: Serialized PolicyFetchResponse protobuf which wraps the
            actual policy data along with an SHA1-RSA signature over the policy
            data. The policy data is opaque to Session Manager, the exact
            definition is only relevant to client code in Chrome.

        Verifies the signature in @policy_blob and persists the blob to disk.

        Device policy is stored in a root-owned location outside of any user's
        cryptohome. It is verified with the device-wide policy key.

        User policy is stored in a root-owned location within the user's
        cryptohome (for privacy reasons). The first attempt to store policy also
        installs the signing key for user policy. This key is used later to
        verify policy updates pushed by Chrome.

        User policy for users without session is rejected by this method.

        Policy for device local accounts is stored in the root-owned
        /var/lib/device_local_accounts directory in the stateful partition.
        Signatures are checked against the owner key, key rotation is not
        allowed.

        Component policy is rejected by the implementation at this point since
        it is stored by Chrome directly.

        Stops the currently running ARC instance. Used to manually stop the ARC
        instance. If the instance is not running, this will result in a no-op.
        If this method is not called, session_manager will still stop the

        |login_manager::ContainerCpuRestrictionState| enum.

        Adjusts the amount of CPU the ARC instance is allowed to use by setting
        the cpu.shares value of ARC's cpu cgroup.  When restriction_state is
        CONTAINER_CPU_RESTRICTION_FOREGROUND the limit is adjusted so ARC can
        use all the system's CPU if needed.  When restriction_state is
        CONTAINER_CPU_RESTRICTION_BACKGROUND, cpu.shares is set back to a
        tightly restricted level.  The ARC container is started in a state that
        is more restricted than CONTAINER_CPU_RESTRICTION_BACKGROUND.  This
        startup state is to allow Chrome to restore during login and can't be
        re-entered after startup is complete.
        Calling the method while the instance is not running *is* okay as long
        as the cgroups exist.
