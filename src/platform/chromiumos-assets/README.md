# Chromium OS Assets

This repository [chromiumos-assets] contains the unofficial, Chromium OS
versions of assets (images, sounds, etc.) that differ between official and
unofficial builds. These files are installed by the [chromiumos-assets package].

See also the [chromeos-assets] (internal only) repo which has official
resources, and the [assets] repo which has resources shared between the two
builds.
