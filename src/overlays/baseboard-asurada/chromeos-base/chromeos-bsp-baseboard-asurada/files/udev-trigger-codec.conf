description     "Replay codec video device udev events"
author          "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job is used to replay events of codec video devices. Chrome queries
# the video nodes for hardware decode and encode capabilities when it starts.
# The video nodes have to be present before it starts. So this job is a task
# and blocks Chrome to start.
#
# To avoid hardcoding the names in udev-trigger.conf, these events are
# replayed again there. But these events are simple and do not increase
# much boot time.
