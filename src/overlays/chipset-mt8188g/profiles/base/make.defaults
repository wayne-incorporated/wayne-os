# MT8188G has 6 Cortex-A55 and 2 Cortex-A78.
# Note that the compiler may or may not support tuning for our big.LITTLE
# combination, so for simplicity we tune the code against the little cores,
# which is not perfect but should give us good enough tuning granularity.
# TODO(b/244126739): Use cortex-a78.cortex-a55 when the compiler is upgraded
# and supports that.
