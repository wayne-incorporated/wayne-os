Cautions and Limitations
---------------------------------------------------
* Caution for printing odd-number pages with 2-Sided Printing If you are
  printing documents with odd-number of pages, a blank page may be added to the
  last page depending on the settings of the operating system  (referred to as
  "OS" hereinafter). Some application software will automatically insert blank
  sheet for page adjustment according to the condition for specifying print
  quantities. As this behavior is a specification of the application software,
  it is not possible to configure this software or the device to prevent blank
  sheet from being inserted to the printout. The target device will print the
  data as it is received after it is edited and printed from the client's side
  according to the operating system or application software specification. If
  the document data to be printed consist of blank-sheet data inserted by the
  operating system or application software, this blank sheet will be counted as
  part of the print data.

* Caution for printing black and white document Depending on the application
  program, black and white document may be printed in color as black can be
  output in process black (C=M=Y). To prevent this, it is recommended to set
  [Color] to [Black & White] when printing black and white documents.
