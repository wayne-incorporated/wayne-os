# This controls the KEYWORDs for the cros_sdk chroot.

# Note: This file is largely deprecated.  It is rare that you should use this.
# - If you want to update the KEYWORDS in an ebuild for all targets, then do it
#   in the ebuild itself (even for portage-stable/).
# - If you want to use different versions in the cros_sdk chroot and the target
#   boards, then use package.mask to control visibility.
