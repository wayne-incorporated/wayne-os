# This script first determines if it needs to run at all: if the cr50 firmware
# image is not present in the local directory this must be happening on a
# board without a cr50 device, no need to do anything.
#
# If the firmware image is present, the script checks the number of previous
# runs saved in a state file. The file name is bound to the firmware image, if
# the firmware image changes, the name of the state file will also have to
# change.
#
# In most cases one firmware update run will be enough, but sometimes more
# than one step will be required (when updating from an old cr50 version or
# when rotating RW keys). The entire chromebook needs to be restarted between
# cr50 update runs, up to four update runs on a particular firmware image are
# allowed by this script.
#
# The gsctool utility exit status indicates if more runs are required. Exit
# status of 0 means update has succeeded. Other exit statuses are processed by
# the follow up startup script cr50-result.conf.

  # Now 'gsctool -f' output is scanned to determine which kind of cr50 device
  # is installed on this system. This is not completely straightforward. A
  # typical output looks as follows:
  #
  # vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
  # target running protocol version 6
  # offsets: backup RO at 0x40000, backup RW at 0x4000
  # keyids: RO 0x3716ee6b, RW 0xb93d6539
  # Current versions:
  # RO 0.0.10
  # RW 0.0.9
  # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  #
  # but older versions of cr50 firmware do not report the key IDs. So, the
  # following cases are possible:
  #
  # - the RW image is older than 0.0.11. In this case each subsequent
  #   invocation of gsctool needs to be delayed by at least 5 seconds (to
  #   return the updater state machine on the device into the idle state).
  #
  # - the /^Keyid: / string is present in the output AND the RO key ID has bit
  #   D2 set. This indicates a prod signed cr50 device. If the string is not
  #   present, or the bit is not set - the cr50 is dev signed.
