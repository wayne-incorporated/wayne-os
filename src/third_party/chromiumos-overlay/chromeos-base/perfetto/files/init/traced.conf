description   "Starts perfetto system tracing service and probes"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# traced is the Perfetto tracing service daemon for collecting performance
# trace of the system. The daemon provides service to entities that writes the
# trace data (producers) and entities that controls trace collection and reads
# collected trace data (consumers) through IPC channels and the entities are
# isolated from each other. See https://perfetto.dev/docs/concepts/service-model
# for more information about the service and http://go/crosetto-security
# (internal doc) about the security design of this service.

# Use ~900 MiB, which is 10 times of peak VM usage from a local session, for the
# limit of VM usage.
# Note that internally perfetto has it's own watchdog and will self-kill if its
# memory budget exceeds SUM(tracing buffers) + 32MB slack.

# --uts: enter a new UTS namespace.
# -n: set no new_privs.
# --profile=minimalistic-mountns -t: set up minimalistic mounts and /tmp.

# Note that option -p is deliberately omitted to make traced run in the root PID
