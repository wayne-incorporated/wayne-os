# Prior to starting usbguard-daemon, the rule files in
# "/etc/usbguard/rules.d/" are concatenated in alphabetical order to
# create the runtime rules configuration at "/run/usbguard/rules.conf".
# Filename prefixes are used to control the order of the included files.
# Here are the prefixes
#   00- is reserved for a default header for all boards.
#   {10..29}- are for high priority rules.
#   {30..59}- are for default priority rules.
#   {60..79}- are for low priority rules.
#   99- is reserved for the default footer for all boards.
# Most board specific configurations should use the "50-" prefix.

# These signals are emitted by session_manager.
#
# screen-unlocked may not be called for every screen-locked event, but
# start-user-session covers those cases.
