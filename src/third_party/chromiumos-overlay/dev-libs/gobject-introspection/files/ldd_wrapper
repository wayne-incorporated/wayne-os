# Wrapper for `ldd` in cross-compilation situations.
#
# gobject-introspection uses `ldd` to inspect the dynamically linked
# dependencies of small binaries it compiles during its build process, but doing
# so requires executing the dynamic loader for that target. This is typically
# not possible in a cross-compilation environment so chromite provides a pure
# Python script that mimics the interface of `ldd` for inspecting dynamically
# linked dependencies.
#
# We explicitly pass $SYSROOT as the "root" argument so that `lddtree` knows to
# look for all dependencies in the build target's sysroot.

# We also pass the --no-auto-root option so that `lddtree` won't implicitly add
# the provided root as a prefix to all paths passed as arguments, otherwise
# paths would end up doubly-prefixed, e.g.
# '/build/$board/build/$board/usr/lib/foo'.
