DESCRIPTION=Generic ebuild which satisifies virtual/service-manager. This is a direct dependency of chromeos-base/chromeos, but can be overridden in an overlay for specialized boards. To satisfy this virtual, a package should cause to be installed everything required to bring the system up and start managing system services.
