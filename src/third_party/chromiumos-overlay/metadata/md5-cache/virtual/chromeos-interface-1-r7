DESCRIPTION=Generic ebuild which satisifies virtual/chromeos-interface. This is a direct dependency of chromeos-base/chromeos, but can be overridden in an overlay for specialized boards. To satisfy this virtual, a package should cause to be installed everything a user would need to interact with the system locally.
